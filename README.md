I am a **Bioinformatics Analyst and Computational Biologist** with 3+ years of experience applying genomics, transcriptomics, and data science to support **pharmaceutical R&D, translational research, and biomarker discovery**. My work focuses on extracting biologically meaningful insights from large-scale omics datasets using reproducible, high-performance computational workflows.

I have hands-on experience across the full RNA-seq and scRNA-seq lifecycle, including quality control, normalization, differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and GSEA-based pathway and network interpretation. I routinely work with **Python, R, Bash, and SQL** in **HPC environments (SLURM)**, emphasizing performance optimization, traceability, and reproducibility.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Bioinformatics from Indiana University (Luddy School of Informatics)**. In parallel, I have industry and research experience supporting **AI-enabled genomics platforms, cloud-based pipelines, and pharmaceutical research workflows**, allowing me to bridge computational biology with regulatory and quality-driven environments.
