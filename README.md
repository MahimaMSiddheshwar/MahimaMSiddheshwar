# 👋 Hi, I’m Mahima .M. Siddheshwar

## 🌟 About Me
I am a Bioinformatics professional passionate about turning complex biological data into actionable insights for pharma R&D and clinical research. My focus lies in transcriptomics, multi-omics integration, and machine learning-based biomarker discovery, leveraging computational methods to understand disease mechanisms and therapeutic response. I specialize in building and optimizing bioinformatics pipelines — from RNA-seq preprocessing and normalization to differential expression, WGCNA, and GSEA-based network analysis. My technical toolkit includes Python, R, Bash, and SQL, with hands-on experience in HPC environments (SLURM) and data visualization using Power BI, Tableau, ggplot2, and Plotly. Pursued my Master’s in Bioinformatics at Indiana University, I’m exploring projects that combine genomics, statistics, and AI to support data-driven decision-making in precision medicine. 
Before this, I completed a certified training at Biocon Academy, where I gained comprehensive exposure to biopharmaceutical processes, GMP, QA, and regulatory systems — a foundation that helps me bridge scientific rigor with computational precision.
I’m now seeking opportunities to apply bioinformatics, AI, and data science in pharmaceutical research, translational genomics, and digital health innovation.

- Genomics and Transcriptomics analysis (RNA-seq, scRNA-seq)
- Developing interactive data dashboards and visualizations using Power BI
- Building scalable databases for healthcare and cancer research
- Molecular docking and structure-based drug design
- Exploring the intersection of computational biology and pharmaceutical quality assurance

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning: 
- Advanced statistical modeling with R and Python  
- Workflow development using NGS tools like STAR, HISAT, and GATK  
- SQL optimization and database management for large-scale biological datasets  
- Machine learning applications in bioinformatics  

## 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On: 
- Open-source projects involving RNA-seq analysis and visualization  
- Building and curating biological databases  
- Integrating bioinformatics tools into pharmaceutical quality control workflows  
- Computational methods for cancer biomarker discovery
