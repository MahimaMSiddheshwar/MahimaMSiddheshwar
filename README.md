## About Me
I am a **Bioinformatics Analyst and Computational Biologist** with over **3 years of experience** supporting research and development through **AI/ML-enabled genomics, transcriptomics, and data-driven analysis**. My work focuses on extracting biologically meaningful insights from large-scale omics datasets to inform **biomarker discovery, therapeutic research, and translational studies**.

I have hands-on experience building **reproducible RNA-seq and scRNA-seq pipelines**, covering upstream preprocessing, normalization, differential expression analysis, WGCNA, and GSEA-based pathway and network interpretation. My work routinely involves **Python, R, Bash, and SQL**, executed on **HPC environments using SLURM**, with an emphasis on performance optimization, traceability, and reproducibility.

I earned my **Master’s degree in Bioinformatics from Indiana University (Luddy School of Informatics)**, where I worked on genomics and global health data analytics projects integrating statistics, machine learning, and visualization. In parallel, I have industry exposure through roles supporting **AI-driven genomics platforms, cloud-based pipelines, and pharmaceutical research workflows**.

Previously, I completed **certified training at Biocon Academy**, gaining structured exposure to **biopharmaceutical manufacturing, GMP systems, QA practices, and regulatory frameworks**. This background allows me to bridge **wet-lab rigor, regulatory awareness, and computational precision**—a combination well-suited for pharmaceutical and translational research environments.

I am currently seeking opportunities to apply **bioinformatics, AI, and data science** in **pharmaceutical R&D, translational genomics, and digital health innovation**.
